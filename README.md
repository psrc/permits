# Residential Permits

The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) in our efforts to conduct an annual [Residential Building Permit Inventory](https://www.psrc.org/residential-building-permits) of the Central Puget Sound. This repository contains scripts needed to clean and standardize the permit files, which are collected from Puget Sound region jurisidctions. 

# Data Collection 
For 2017 residential permit inventory project, We seek a record for each residential building permit meeting the following criteria:	

•	Issued during calendar year 2017,
•	Cancelled, expired, or withdrawn in 2017,
•	Issued prior to, but finaled during calendar year 2017,
•	New/added dwelling unit,
•	Demolished/lost dwelling unit,	
•	Conversion that alters the number of dwelling units in an existing structure.

# Applications
The permit data serve as a valuable tool for tracking housing, land use, and growth management trends and policies. The permit data also supports the development of other PSRC datasets that are widely used by local planners and policy-makers in the areas of growth management and transportation. PSRC also geocodes the permit records to allow for mapping and analysis using geographic information systems (GIS) applications.

# Public Data 
The data summery is avalable on [PSRC data and resource](https://www.psrc.org/residential-building-permits).
